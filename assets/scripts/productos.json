A steel ball is mounted in the center of a disc at each end of the 15-cm-high clear plastic cylinder. When the balls are positioned over one another and at a right angle to the film, their images will appear as one if the central ray is truly perpendicular to the film.

Applications For fine-tuning of radiographic and fluoroscopic imaging systems, it is recommended that the phantom be imaged at least monthly on all radiographic and fluoroscopic equipment. To attain the most accurate, up-to-date quality control information, a daily or weekly frequency is preferable. When used daily, the R/F QC Phantom will allow the technologist to quickly determine whether the equipment is functioning correctly. This easy-to-use phantom allows the user to complete the suggested protocol in approximately 5 minutes or less, when used on a standard R/F system. Once the phantom is imaged, simply graph the results to determine any trends that may indicate a degradation of imaging system performance, such as a steady but slow change in the fluoro kVp or in the radiographic mAs. Designed specifically with the radiologic technologist in mind Provides an accurate overall evaluation of image quality consistency For QC of phototimer and automatic brightness control consistency Ideal for use in determining subtle degradation in imaging performance Average test time is less than 5 minutes per unit For use with radiography, fluoroscopy, and spot films, too",

One exposure is then made centered over each hole in the test plate. After processing, the film (image) is examined for potential changes in optical density. A properly centered and level grid should provide 5 equal densities on the test film (image). The test kit includes one holed test plate, 9\" x 3.5\", with 5 test holes.

The Model L-435 HVL Filter Holder eliminates the need to use tape to attach the HVL filters to the collimator housing. The Filter Holder consists of a polycarbon base 9.5\" x 9.5\". Permanently bonded to the center of the base plate is an acrylic pocket, open on one side and designed to hold a standard or high purity Al Filter set. The polycarbon material is easily cut with a standard utility knife or sheers to accommodate the two most common collimator track sizes in a given department. The base may also be attached with the provided hook & loop type strips for odd sized collimators. In either case the filters themselves are protected from damage associated with the application and removal of heavy medical/surgical tape.",

        "description": "Model L-629 Rotating Spoke Test Tool is designed to evaluate the performance of the Fluoroscopic Imaging Systems. The tool demonstrates screen image lag, motion blur, contrast, and related distortions encountered in fluoroscopic examinations. When combined with aluminum or acrylic block attenuators, the Rotating Spoke Test Tool provides the user with a means to simulate the movement of guide wires and radiopaque catheters, seen in Angiography or Cardiac Cath patient procedures. The Rotating Spoke Test Pattern consists of a circular 5.5 inch diameter acrylic disk with steel 12 wires arranged on its surface in 30 degree intervals. The wire diameters range from 0.02\" to 0.005\". There are two wires of each size directly opposite each other on the disk. Lead numbers (1-6) appear on each half of the disk near the perimeter. The disk is mounted on a synchronous motor with a speed of 30 RPM to simulate movement of wires. The visibility of smaller diameter wires ( 0.014\" or less) will confirm the system performance. [ 0.14\" is a common guide wire size ] Motor Power: Available in 115V and 220V. Wire Sizes (diameter): 0.005; 0.008; 0.010; 0.014; 0.016 and 0.022 inches. Disk diameter: 5.5\" Disk Thickness: 1/4\"",
